# 🚀 Foundry NFT Project

*  This project contains two ERC‑721 NFT contracts built with Foundry: a simple metadata‑URI NFT (BasicNft) and a fully on‑chain, mood‑flipping NFT (MoodNft). It also includes deployment, minting scripts, and tests.

  

## 🛠 Tech stack

* 💻  Solidity 0.8.x (with built-in overflow checks).

* 🧪  Foundry for compiling, testing, and scripting.

* 🛡 OpenZeppelin ERC721 + Base64 utilities for secure, standard NFTs

  

## NFT types 🖼 🖼 

* 🐾 BasicNft: classic ERC721 that stores an off-chain metadata URI (e.g., IPFS).

* MoodNft: fully on‑chain dynamic NFT; image and metadata live inside the contract, and the owner can flip its mood (HAPPY😃/SAD😢).
